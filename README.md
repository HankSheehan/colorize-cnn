# colorize-cnn
A convolutional neural network to colorize grayscale images.

## Abstract
This project is to explore the possibilites of colorizing grayscale images using convolutional neural network. There should be an input of a grayscale image of any dimension and an output of an RGB image of the same dimension, representing the grayscale image in color.

## Overview
The neural network is created with Python using the Keras framework. The dataset will be the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Hardware
This model will trained on my 13-inch Macbook with no GPU, so let's see how it goes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
