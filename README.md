# colorize-cnn
A convolutional neural network to colorize grayscale images.

## Abstract
This project is to explore the possibilites of colorizing grayscale images using convolutional neural network. There should be an input of a grayscale image of any dimension and an output of an RGB image of the same dimension, representing the grayscale image in color.

## Overview
The neural network is created with Python using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) framework on top of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). The dataset will be the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.

## Hardware
This model will trained on my 13-inch Macbook with no GPU, so let's see how it goes ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
